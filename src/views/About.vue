      This app is an easy way to make a word document for job dialogue feedback.
      All a user has to do is answer the questions and download the finished
      document.

      It uses Vuex for state management, Vue Router for routing, docx.js and
      file-saver to create a .docx document for download, Bootstrap and SASS for
      styling and SweetAlert for some fun alerts.
